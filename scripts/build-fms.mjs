// 分散式 FMS — local declarations + build-time consensus projection.
//
// The name is Metron's and it is more accurate than "distributed FMS": what is
// distributed is three AIs' declarations and editing responsibility, not a
// runtime. Nothing here needs CRDTs, quorum or vector clocks.
//
// v2, 2026-08-13, after five blocking objections from Metron and Pragma, all of
// which held. What changed:
//
//   1. EQUALITY IS NOT APPROVAL. Three identical files proved three identical
//      files — I wrote all three in one commit. Consensus now requires an
//      explicit attestation from each owner, over a claim id and a digest.
//   2. Aggregation is per claim id, not per top-level key, so item-level
//      agreement is visible instead of being hidden by whatever else a branch
//      happens to hold.
//   3. Comparison is over canonical JSON, so key order stops manufacturing
//      divergence. The actor set is exactly three names and the filename must
//      agree with `_branch`; anything else fails closed instead of silently
//      gaining a vote.
//   4. A BRANCH EDIT NO LONGER REVOKES AN EFFECTIVE ENTRY. The old rule treated
//      proposing a candidate as cancelling a version the other two still held,
//      which compiled a violation of 模組 06 替代先於移除 into the mechanism.
//      Effective entries live in an append-only ledger and are superseded, never
//      deleted.
//   5. The trunk is still never hand-written — but it is also not "absent
//      between builds", which was my overclaim. effective.json is tracked and
//      can be stale; the publish gate recomputes and must agree with it.
